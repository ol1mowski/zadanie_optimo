First I will prepare the room by removing all furniture and coveringthe floor with protective sheets. 
I will also take down any posters and curtains. Next I will paint the walls in a light warm colour. 
Before painting I will clean the walls and apply primer to make the paint last longer.
Then I will add two coats of paint for an even result. If the floor needs improvement I will replace the carpet with wooden panels.
I will measure the room buy the necessary materials and install the panels carefully. 
After that I will bring in new furniture such as a desk a bed and shelves.
To make the space more comfortable I will add plants pictures and new curtains. 
Finally I will clean the whole room arrange the furniture properly and check that everything is in good condition.
